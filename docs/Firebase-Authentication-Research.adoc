== 1. Introduction

This research evaluates the use of Firebase Authentication to support login, registration, session management, and role-based access control for the proposed UPRM Lost & Found platform.

The A3 emphasizes security, accountability, and structured system management. To meet these goals, a secure authentication system is required to ensure that only authorized users can access platform features such as posting items, claiming objects, and moderating listings.

This document analyzes Firebase Authentication capabilities, session handling options, role-based authorization, and integration with Firebase services. It also provides recommendations aligned with the platform’s security and scalability requirements.

== 2. Authentication Requirements for the Platform

Based on the A3 and system workflow, the platform requires the following authentication capabilities:

=== 2.1 User Registration

Account creation using institutional email

Secure password handling

Email verification

Prevention of duplicate or fraudulent accounts

=== 2.2 Login and Session Management

Secure login process

Persistent session management

Logout functionality

Protection against unauthorized access

=== 2.3 Role-Based Authorization

Differentiation between Admin, Founder, and Item Owner

Controlled access to sensitive operations

Secure role assignment

Enforcement of permissions at the database level

These requirements must be implemented securely while minimizing backend complexity.

== 3. Firebase Authentication Capabilities

Firebase Authentication provides built-in solutions for secure identity management.

=== 3.1 Supported Authentication Methods

Firebase supports:

Email and password authentication

OAuth providers such as Google

Secure token-based authentication

For this platform, email/password and Google authentication are the most relevant options.

=== 3.2 Session Management

Firebase automatically manages user sessions using:

ID tokens

Refresh tokens

For web applications, session persistence can be configured as:

Local – User remains signed in

Session-based – Session ends when browser closes

None – User must log in again after refresh

This flexibility supports both personal and shared device usage.

=== 3.3 Integration with Firebase Services

Firebase Authentication integrates directly with:

Firestore

Cloud Storage

Firebase Security Rules

Authentication data and custom claims can be referenced in security rules, allowing permissions to be enforced at the database level rather than relying solely on frontend logic.

== 4. Role-Based Access Plan

The platform defines three primary roles:

Admin – Manages users and moderates listings

Founder – The person who found the item

Item Owner – The person who retrieves the item

Roles are assigned using Firebase Custom Claims through the Firebase Admin SDK. This ensures:

Users cannot modify their own roles

Role assignment is controlled server-side

Authorization logic is securely enforced

Firestore and Cloud Storage Security Rules will restrict access based on these roles.

Example structure:

Admin: Full read/write access

Founder: Can post found items

Item Owner: Can report lost items and claim matched objects

This model ensures structured access control aligned with the platform’s workflow.

== 5. Security and Risk Considerations

Although Firebase simplifies authentication, several risks must be considered.

=== 5.1 Unauthorized Access

If authentication is misconfigured, users may gain unintended privileges.

Mitigation:

Enforce role checks in Firestore Security Rules

Never rely only on frontend validation

Assign roles using Admin SDK only

=== 5.2 Token Mismanagement

Improper token handling could expose session vulnerabilities.

Mitigation:

Use Firebase’s built-in token lifecycle management

Avoid storing tokens insecurely on the client

Enforce HTTPS for all communications

=== 5.3 Role Escalation Attempts

Users may attempt to alter their own role.

Mitigation:

Restrict custom claim assignment to server-side logic

Validate role before executing sensitive operations

== 6. Trade-Off Analysis

|===
| Decision | Benefit | Risk

| Use Firebase built-in authentication
| Faster implementation and strong security
| Vendor dependency

| Role-based custom claims
| Structured authorization control
| Requires careful backend configuration

| Persistent sessions
| Better user experience
| Slightly increased security exposure on shared devices
|===

A balanced implementation using secure session settings and strict security rules is recommended.

== 7. Final Recommendations

To align with the A3 security and accountability objectives, the following measures are recommended:

Require authentication for posting, claiming, and messaging.

Use institutional email verification when possible.

Assign roles using Firebase Custom Claims via Admin SDK.

Enforce role permissions directly in Firestore Security Rules.

Avoid exposing sensitive operations to client-side logic.

Configure appropriate session persistence for web users.

These measures provide secure identity management while maintaining usability and scalability.

== 8. Conclusion

Firebase Authentication meets the platform’s requirements for secure login, session management, and structured role-based authorization.

Its integration with Firestore and Cloud Storage allows permissions to be enforced at the database level, strengthening overall system security.

By implementing proper role controls, secure session handling, and strict security rules, Firebase Authentication provides a reliable foundation for the UPRM Lost & Found platform.
