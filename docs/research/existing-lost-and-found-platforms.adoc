= [Research] Research Existing Lost and Found Platforms #26

== Goal
Identify and analyze existing lost and found platforms to understand common features,
user journeys, and UI/UX design that can inform the design of our own platform.

== Proposed Solution
* Research lost and found platforms.
* Identify core features such as item reporting, search/filtering, user accounts,
notifications, and moderation.
* Document how users report lost vs. found items.
* Analyze UI/UX patterns.
* Note any unique or innovative features worth considering.
* Summarize findings in a shared document or GitHub comment.

== Success Criteria
* At least 3–5 existing lost-and-found platforms are reviewed.
** https://www.lostings.com/
** https://www.kanpid.com/
** https://troov.com/en

* A clear list of common and optional features is documented.
** Accounts to keep track of who lost or found the items.
*** Name.
*** Contact information. (phone number, email address, etc.)
** Categories for commonly lost items. (Optionally include images for those
categories)
** Separation between lost and found items:
*** Lost items
**** Location where it was lost
**** Image of item
**** Brand of item
**** Color of item (Primary and Secondary)
**** Date lost
**** Time lost
**** Section for additional information
*** Found items
**** Location where it was found
**** Image of item
**** Brand of item
**** Color of item (Primary and Secondary)
**** Date found
**** Time found
**** Section for additional information
** Can view all lost and found items together with identifying markers on the images
if still lost or found.
** Including an authentication question from the person who lost the item to prove
it's theirs.
** Alerting the owner that their item was found through the lost post.
** A google map incorporated into where the item was located.

* Strengths and weaknesses of each platform are identified.
** Strengths:
*** Can view recently lost items.
*** Map to indicate where it was located.
*** Images for categories to quickly identify distinct sections.
*** Thorough description of items based on the common fields.
*** Notifying the user of the lost item being found.
** Weaknesses:
*** No filtering:
**** per item category.
**** per date.
**** by priority.
*** No Moderation.

* Feature ideas relevant to a campus environment are highlighted.
** Per building having a designated location for the lost and found to centralize and
facilitate recovery, including a field where it was dropped off within the platform.
** After a certain period of time archiving the items that were returned to the owner.
** Dashboard to keep track of items recovered and returned to the owner.
** Viewability of items in a social media format, such as instagram 3 columns and
the information field format in common functionalities.

* Findings are shared with the team and accessible in the repository.
