== Conclusion: Applicability to Lost & Found Platforms

Research shows that successful online marketplaces rely on a multi-layered trust and fraud prevention approach, combining identity verification, reputation systems, financial protections, and behavioral monitoring. However, the models used are primarily designed for transaction-based marketplaces involving monetary exchange. 

=== Recommended Approach for Lost & Found Platforms

Instead of payment-heavy protection systems adapted from e-commerce, the platform should prioritize:

. Proof-of-Ownership Validation
.. Require detailed item descriptions matching finder-submitted photos
.. Enable private verification questions 
.. Implement visual matching tools

. Strong Reporting & Moderation Tools
.. Manual review queue for flagged listings

. Platform-Controlled Communication
.. Clear guidance on public meetup locations
