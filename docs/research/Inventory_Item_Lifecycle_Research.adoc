= Inventory and Item Lifecycle Research
  
Adriel Bracero Gonzalez

== Summary

This document provides a concise concept for the inventory and item lifecycle of 
the Lost and Found app. It defines a recommended data model, item lifecycle states, 
chain-of-custody logging, retention/disposition policies, small Python examples, and a 
test plan. The recommendations draw on evidence-management guidance and best 
inventory practices.  


== Scope and Objectives

Objective: Produce an actionable specification to implement item inventory, 
custody tracking, and retention workflows so the application supports real-world 
operations (campus or venue lost and found).  

Audience: Developers, managers, theoretical/venue stakeholders, and personnel who will 
interact with found items.  


== Key Definitions

Item record — A digital representation of a found object, including descriptive metadata, photos, and location/time information.

Custody log — A timestamped record of every physical or administrative transfer or action performed on an item (who, when, why). 

Retention / Holding period — The amount of time an item is kept before intermediate or final disposition (examples:  donation, return to finder, destruction).




== Recommended Data Model

 The data model below is intentionally simple, extensible, and suitable for 
relational or document databases. Field names are descriptive; types in parentheses are suggestions.  
Item (table/document):  
- item_id: string / UUID — unique identifier  
- title: string — short readable title  
- description: text — free-text description  
- category: enum — electronics, wallet, keys, clothing, ID, etc.  
- tags: array of strings — user or controlled tags  
- photos: array of image URLs or storage references  
- found_at_time: datetime
- found_at_location: geo-point (latitude, longitude) or textual location
- storage_location_id: string — physical locker/room identifier
- status: enum — reported, cataloged, stored, claimed, disposed , etc.
- reporter_id: string — user or staff who reported the item
- reported_at: datetime
- expected_hold_until: datetime — computed by app
- custody_log: array of custody entries (see below)
- sensitive_flag: boolean — marks items requiring special handling




== Custody Log (Chain of Custody)

Every action that meaningfully changes an item's physical or legal status must 
append a custody log entry. The chain-of-custody preserves integrity and accountability.  
Recommended custody entry fields:  

- timestamp: datetime
- actor_id: string — user/staff identifier
- action: enum — intake, transfer, photo_added, claim_started, claim_completed, dispose
- from_location: string — optional
- to_location: string — optional
- notes: text — optional
- attachments: array — photos or signatures



== Item Lifecycle States and Transitions

A clear finite state machine (FSM) limits errors and enforces authorization. 

Suggested states (with short descriptions): 

- reported: Item has been reported via app but not processed
- cataloged: Staff reviewed, added photos, assigned storage  
- stored: Physically in storage and available for claims  
- pending_claim: A claim has been made and is under verification  
- claimed: Ownership verified; item released to owner  
- unclaimed: Holding period expired and no successful claim  
- disposed: Item disposed (donated, sold, recycled, destroyed)

Transitions should be explicit and require actor roles (examples: volunteer/staff). 
Example transition rules: reported → cataloged (staff only); cataloged → stored (staff); 
stored → pending_claim (owner initiates); pending_claim → claimed (after verification); 
stored → unclaimed (after hold expiry).  


== Retention and Disposition Policy (Recommendations)

Holding periods vary by institution. University examples range from 30 to 120+ 
days. Consider offering configurable policies per region or venue.  
Suggested default policy tiers:  

- Tier A (High-value or sensitive items): hold 90–120 days; require staff verification for disposal.  

- Tier B (Everyday items: keys, clothing): hold 30–60 days; then donate or recycle.  

- Tier C (Perishable or illegal items): follow local laws and escalate to authorities immediately. 

Automated actions at hold expiry should either notify for manual disposition or follow 
preconfigured disposal actions. Always store a disposal record in the custody_log.  


== API and Backend Sketch

Below are minimal endpoints to support inventory operations. These are sketches— exact fields may differ by framework.  
 
POST / items  
- Create a new item record (reporter creates).  
 
GET/items / item_id  
- Retrieve an item with custody log.  
 
PATCH / items / item_ id/status  
- Update status (requires authorization). Example payload: { 'status': 'cataloged' }  

 
POST / items / item_id / custody  
- Append a custody_log entry.  
 
GET / items? Status = stored and near = true 
- Search items by status and proximity.  
 
POST / items / item_id / claim  
- Start a claim process. Creates a pending_claim entry and triggers verification 
workflow.  


== Small Python Examples

Example: Minimal data model objects and custody append function (illustrative):  
 
[source,python]
----
from datetime import datetime
from uuid import uuid4
def make_item(title, description, found_time, lat, lon, reporter_id):
    return {
        "item_id": str(uuid4()),
        "title": title,
        "description": description,
        "found_at_time": found_time.isoformat(),
        "found_at_location": {"lat": lat, "lon": lon},
        "status": "reported",
        "reporter_id": report er_id,
        "reported_at": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "custody_log": []
    }
----



[source,python]
----
def append_custody(item, actor_id, action, notes=None, to_location=None):
    entry = {
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "actor_id": ac tor_id,
        "action": action,
        "from_location": item.get("storage_location_id"),
        "to_location": to_location,
        "notes": notes
    }
    item.setdefault("custody_log", []).append(entry)
    return item
----


#Example: Computing expected_hold_until according to policy:  
 
[source,python]
----
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
def compute_hold_until(reported_at, tier="B"):
    reported = datetime.fromisoformat(reported_at)
    if tier == "A":
        days = 90
    elif tier == "B":
        days = 30
    else:
        days = 14
    return (reported + timedelta(days=days)).isoformat()
----



== UX and Operational Notes

Intake flow (recommended): Reporter submits report → Staff reviews and catalogs → Item assigned storage label → Photos and short form added → Item status becomes 'stored'.

Claim flow (recommended): Owner searches (keywords, filters, proximity) → Initiates claim → Verification step (staff asks for identifying details) → On success, staff records custody transfer and marks 'claimed'.

Suggestions for verification: Ask for at least two of (photo on phone showing the item, description of unique markings, date/time/place last seen, serial number). Avoid requesting sensitive personal information.  


== Security and Privacy Considerations

Minimize personally identifiable information (PII) stored on public item records. 
Use hashed/verifiable secrets for claim verification (example, token sent to reporter's 
phone/email), and mark sensitive items for restricted handling. Store photos and 
attachments in access-controlled object storage. Log all accesses to item records for 
auditability.
