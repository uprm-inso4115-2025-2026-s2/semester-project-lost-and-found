== Goal

Ensure that notifications in the Lost and Found platform are timely, relevant, and helpful, increasing the likelihood of item recovery while avoiding notification overload for users.

The notification system should support effective communication between item owners and finders, encourage user engagement, and improve the overall efficiency of the lost-and-found process at UPRM.

== Description

Notifications play a critical role in keeping users informed and engaged within the Lost and Found application. Since the platform relies on real-time reporting and matching of lost and found items, notifications are needed to promptly alert users when meaningful events occur.

The app will notify students when:

* An item matching the description of their lost item is reported.
* Their lost item has been marked as found.
* Someone comments on or responds to their post
* A finder or owner sends them a direct message.
* Important updates occur, such as item status changes or administrative actions.

Well-designed notifications reduce response time, improve recovery rates, and minimize the need for users to constantly check the app manually.

== Implementation Plan

==== When Notifications Are Useful for This App


Notifications will be sent only when they provide clear value, such as:

* High-confidence matches between lost and found item descriptions.
* Direct user interactions (messages or comments).
* Time-sensitive updates (item claimed, flagged, or removed).

Low-value or repetitive notifications will be avoided to prevent user fatigue.

==== Select Appropriate Notification Types


Based on research, the Lost and Found app should use:

* Push notifications for urgent or high-priority events (item match, item found).
* In-app notifications for comments, messages, and status updates.
* Optional email notifications as a backup for critical alerts, configurable by the user.

Users should be able to customize notification preferences to control frequency and type.
