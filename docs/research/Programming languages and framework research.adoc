The purpose of this research is to help on the selection of the most appropiate programming language and backend platform for 
the development of the lost and found project. This research compares JavaScript with TypeScript and Firebase with Supabase, since
these languages and frameworks seem the most relevant for the project.

JavaScript vs TypeScript

    JavaScript:

    Pros
    - Simpler to start with
    - No compilation step
    - Flexible and fast for prototyping

    Cons
    - No static typing (which can lead to more runtime errors)
    - Harder to maintain in large projects
    - Refactoring can be risky

    TypeScript:

    Pros
    - Static typing
    - Better IDE support and autocompletion
    - Safer Refactoring

    Cons
    - Has a slightly bigger learning curve
    - Requires compilation step
    - More initial setup

    At a small scale JavaScript works fine, but as features grow, the risk of bugs
    increases without type safety

Firebase vs Supabase

    Firebase:

    Pros
    - Mature ecosystem
    - Easy authentication setup
    - Scales well
    - Has a big community

    Cons
    - NoSQL (Firestore) by default
    - Less SQL flexibility
    - Pricing can become expensive at scale

    Supabase:

    Pros
    - SQL-based
    - Open Source
    - Built in authentication
    - Row-level security
    - More transparent Pricing

    Cons
    - Smaller ecosystem than Firebase
    - Newer platform in comparison

    PostgreSQL (Supabase) handles relational data better than Firestore

Between JavaScript and TypeScript,TypeScriptis recommended due to its static typing system, maintainability and
better scalability for team based development.

Between Firebase and Supabase, Supabase is recommended due to its PostgreSQL system and its open source nature.
